** Graphical Abstract **

A hallmark of intelligent behavior is that we can separate intention from action. To understand the mechanism that gates
the flow of information between motor planning and execution, we compared the activity of frontal eye field neurons with
motor unit activity from neck muscles in the presence of an intervening delay period in which spatial information regarding
the target was available to plan a response. Whereas spatially-specific delay period activity was present in the activity of
frontal eye field neurons, it was absent in motor unit activity. Nonetheless, motor unit activity was correlated with the
time it took to initiate saccades. Interestingly, we observed a heterogeneity of responses amongst motor units, such that
only units with smaller amplitudes showed a clear modulation during the delay period. These small amplitude motor units 
also had higher spontaneous activity compared to the units which showed modulation only during the movement epoch. Taken
together, our results suggest the activity of smaller motor units convey temporal information and explains how the delay 
period primes muscle activity leading to faster reaction times.
 

Significance statement
------------------------

This study shows that the temporal aspects of a motor plan in the oculomotor circuitry can be accessed by peripheral 
neck muscles hundreds of milliseconds prior to the instruction to initiate a saccadic eye movement. The coupling between
central and peripheral processes during the delay time is mediated by the recruitment pattern of motor units with smaller
amplitude. These findings suggest that information processed in cortical areas could be read from periphery prior to 
execution.
