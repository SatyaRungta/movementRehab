Welcome to Neurophys's documentation!
*********************************************

I would like to take this opportunity to thank *Primate Research Lab facility*, *Centre for Neuroscience* and **IISc Mathematics Initiative**
for giving me space, required help and for allowing me to carry out my *doctoral thesis* at **Indian institute of science (IISc)**. I would like to
thank my professor, Dr. Aditya Murthy for his constant support and guidance. Numerous discussion and views about science and in general life 
has inspired me and kept me motivated in doing research. Also, I would like to thank Prof. G. Rangarajan, Dr. Rajesh Rao and Prof. Aditya Murthy
for giving me an opportunity to go and work in Seattle, meet different researchers in the field and open me to see and understand not just 
different aspects of neuroscience but also various cultures abroad. I would like to thank Prof. Arun Sripati, Prof. Supratim Ray and Prof. Sreedhar 
for their teachings during my course work and for giving me feedback and suggestions which has been valuable for my thesis. I would like to 
thank, the PRL, CNS and IMI staff for their help whenever required.

Itâ€™s been seven years and it feels like it was just yesterday when I arrived here at IISc. From being a collage undergraduate to an applied 
mathematician/ neuroscientist, the journey has been fascinating and mixed with all sorts of emotions. So lets get started... !!
