Figures and graph for time to event analysis for multiple sensors data processing
Data: Neuro and Myo electrophysiology  

BMI or brain machine interface relies on electrical signals and data captured using multiple sensors. We used time to event analysis for analysing neuronal and motor unit data using raster-based method.

Some of the datascience methods used for the project are: 
- Time series analysis
- ROC analysis
- LATER or Regression based models (Linear Accumulation to Threshold based on Ergodic Rate)
- Simple Statistics (t-test, ANOVA)

## Yet to explore:
- Time to event based models using survival analysis
- Causal inferences and Statistics
