# Figures and graph for time to event analysis for Neural and EMG data from multiple sensors

BMI or brain machine interface relies on electrical signals and data captured using multiple sensors. For our purpose, we use time to event analysis for analysing neuronal data and motor units using raster-based method to look at activity of different type of neurons and to search for preparatory responses in putative motor units captured using multiple electrodes placed on muscles.

Some of the datascience methods used are: 
- Time series analysis
- ROC analysis
- LATER or Regression based models (Linear Accumulation to Threshold based on Ergodic Rate)
- Simple Statistics (t-test, ANOVA)

## Yet to explore:
- Causality
- Risk based models (survival analysis)
- Data driven and Regression based Causal models
- Statistics
